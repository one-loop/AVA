## ðŸ’™ Contributing

It would be great if anybody reading this could volunteer. My goal is to have people collaborating on this project from all over the world.

Weâ€™d like to build a team of content creators, programmers, writers, graphic designers, researchers, managers etc.  If you want to sign up to volunteer, you can sign up to be a volunteer here: [AVA Volunteer Application Form](https://one-loop.github.io/AVA/volunteer.html)

Also, sharing the project with people you think would find it useful would also be amazing :)
Thanks
